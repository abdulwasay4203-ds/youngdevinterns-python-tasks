📘 youngdevinterns-python-tasks

This repository contains all the tasks completed during my Python Internship.
The tasks cover beginner-level programs, intermediate Python concepts, and a complete mini-project built using OOP + File Handling.

🔥 📂 Task 3 – Beginner-Level Python Programs

Foundational Python exercises that helped build logic and confidence in basic coding:

fibonacci.py — Print Fibonacci sequence

prime number.py — Check if a number is prime

reverse string.py — Reverse any string

Calculator.py — Simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)

factorial.py — Find factorial of a number

🚀 📂 Task 4 – Python Concepts (Intermediate)

Applied Python concepts such as Lists, Dictionaries, Classes, Functions, and File Handling.

Word frequency Counter.py — Count word frequency using lists/dictionaries

file.py — Read/write student records (File Handling)

class.py — Simple Student class demonstrating OOP concepts

🏛️ 📂 Task 5 – Library Management System (Mini Project)

A real-world console-based project created using:

✔ Object-Oriented Programming (Classes)
✔ Functions (Modular Code)
✔ File Handling (persistent storage)

📌 Features:
